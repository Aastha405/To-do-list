## 📝 Project Title: On-Chain ToDoList DApp

## 📌 Project Description

The ToDoList is a decentralized task management system built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It allows users to create, manage, and organize their daily tasks in a trustless, immutable, and transparent manner. All operations — from adding to deleting tasks — are handled via smart contract functions, ensuring decentralized access and full user control over their data.

## 🎯 Project Vision

To empower individuals with a blockchain-based productivity tool that ensures task management is transparent, secure, and censorship-resistant. By building an open, permissionless To-Do List, we aim to introduce users to the utility of decentralized applications through a familiar real-world use case.

## 🚀 Key Features

# Add Task: Create a new task with a simple description.
# Update Task: Modify the task description.
# Mark as Completed: Mark tasks as completed.
# Toggle Completion: Toggle task completion status.
# Delete Task: Remove tasks by index.
