# Blockchain-based To-Do List

## Project Description
A simple decentralized To-Do List where users can add and complete their tasks. Once added to the blockchain, tasks are immutable and recorded forever. The project demonstrates how even basic applications can leverage blockchain’s transparency and security.

## Project Vision
To showcase a lightweight and beginner-friendly example of how decentralized applications (dApps) can function for daily use cases like task management. 
The vision is to move from centralized databases to transparent, trustless systems.

## Key Features
- Add new tasks that are permanently recorded on the blockchain.
- Mark tasks as completed — updating the task status.
- Transparent, public, and verifiable list of tasks for all users.

## Future Scope
- Assign due dates to tasks.
- Add user-specific task ownership.
- Enable deletion (soft delete) with event logging.
- Add a front-end (React or Next.js) to interact with the smart contract easily.
- Integrate gasless transactions using meta-transactions for a smoother UX.
