# ToDoList Smart Contract

## 📝 Project Title
**ToDoList DApp - A Simple Ethereum-Based Task Manager**

## 📌 Project Description
The ToDoList smart contract is a decentralized task management system built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, providing a trustless and transparent way to manage personal or shared to-do items.

## 🎯 Project Vision
The vision behind ToDoList is to offer a simple yet powerful decentralized alternative to traditional to-do apps. By leveraging blockchain, the project aims to demonstrate how even basic productivity tools can be made censorship-resistant, transparent, and immutable.

## 🚀 Key Features
- ✅ **Add Task**: Users can create new tasks with descriptions.
- ✔️ **Mark Task as Completed**: Tasks can be marked completed by their index.
- ❌ **Delete Task**: Users can remove a task from the list by specifying its index.
- 📊 **Get Task Count**: Returns the total number of tasks created.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- 🔐 **Access Control**: Add ownership or user-based task access using wallet addresses.
- 🌐 **Front-End Integration**: Build a React-based frontend to interact with the smart contract via Web3.js or Ethers.js.
- 🧾 **Event Logging**: Emit events for actions like task creation, completion, and deletion to enable real-time UI updates.
- 📱 **Mobile Support**: Integrate with wallets like MetaMask Mobile and Trust Wallet for mobile task management.
- 💾 **Off-chain Storage**: Integrate IPFS or Filecoin for storing extended task metadata or attachments.
