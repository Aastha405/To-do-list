The aim is to bring a decentralized productivity app where users own their data and can transparently manage tasks in a tamper-proof way using smart contracts.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Add new tasks with timestamps.
- Update or delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
- Toggle task completion.
- Count completed/pending tasks.
- Get individual task details.
- Retrieve all tasks.
- Clear all tasks.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integrate with a frontend (React + Web3.js or Ethers.js).
- Enable user authentication via wallet.
- Store metadata on IPFS.
- Add role-based access and multi-user support.
- Include due dates and reminder notifications.

## 🔧 Deployment
