# 🧾 Project Title: Blockchain-Based To-Do List

---

## 📘 Project Description

A simple yet powerful decentralized To-Do List application where users can add and mark tasks as completed on the blockchain. Each task is permanently recorded, ensuring data transparency and security. This dApp demonstrates how everyday utility apps can transition from traditional centralized systems to decentralized, tamper-proof alternatives.

Built using Solidity for the smart contract logic and deployable on any EVM-compatible blockchain (like Ethereum, Polygon, etc.), this project serves as a foundational example for developers exploring the Web3 ecosystem.

## 🎯 Project Vision

The vision of this project is to serve as a beginner-friendly and functional demonstration of decentralized application (dApp) development. In a world where data ownership and privacy are becoming increasingly important, this to-do list app encourages developers and users alike to consider trustless systems for even the simplest daily utilities.

By eliminating centralized control, we aim to:
- Introduce blockchain to productivity apps
- Encourage transparency and decentralization
- Inspire developers to think beyond DeFi and NFTs

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **Add New Tasks**  
  Tasks are permanently recorded on-chain, with a unique ID and timestamp.

- 🟢 **Mark as Completed**  
  Tasks can be updated to a “completed” state, recorded immutably on the blockchain.

- 🔍 **View All Tasks**  
  The list of tasks is public and verifiable, promoting transparency.

- 🛡️ **Tamper-Proof History**  
  Once written, task data cannot be modified or deleted — ensuring auditability and trust.

- 🧑‍💻 **Developer-Friendly Architecture**  
  Designed for quick deployment and experimentation with Solidity + Hardhat.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- 📅 **Due Dates & Reminders**  
  Add optional due dates and smart notifications.

- 👤 **User-Specific Ownership**  
  Link tasks to individual wallet addresses so users can manage their own list.

- 🗑️ **Soft Delete with Logging**  
  Implement archival or soft delete (status update instead of deletion), while keeping the action recorded for history.

- 💻 **Frontend Interface (React/Next.js)**  
  A user-friendly UI to interact with the smart contract via MetaMask or WalletConnect.

- ⛽ **Gasless Transactions**  
  Integrate meta-transactions to cover gas fees for users, improving onboarding.

- 📲 **Mobile Compatibility**  
  Wrap the dApp into a mobile interface using React Native or Flutter + Web3 support.
